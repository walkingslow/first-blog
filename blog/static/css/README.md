# Core Design
GEâ€™s digital presence is growing with new solutions, new people, and new styles. Creating and following standard design guidelines is pivotal for our success. As more people and products are added to GE digital landscape, the challenge of building one digital brand multiplies exponentially. Core Design addresses this challenge of creating coherent and consistent experiences across all digital channels, with the exception of Predix. If you are working on an indistiral application, use [Predix UI](http://predixdev.github.io/predix-ui/?show=landing_page&type=home) to access the desgin guidelines. 

Core Design offers you a complete and flexible set of design elements, components, patters, and tools as individual artifacts. Based on your requirements and customer needs, you can pick artifacts from the Core Design library and assemble your complete structure.
