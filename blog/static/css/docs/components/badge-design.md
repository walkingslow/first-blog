#Badges
###Overview
The **ge-badge** component is typically a small visual element that contains numbers, text, or icons. It provides a visual clue to help users discover additional relevant content. You can use a badge to unobtrusively draw the user's attention to items they might not otherwise notice, or to emphasize that items may need their attention. A badge can be both a notifier that notifies the additional items associated with an object and an indicator of the number of items associated with the object. A badge is almost always positioned in proximity to other interactive UI elements so the user has a convenient way to access the additional information indicated by the badge.

###Usage
#####Common Examples:
* "New messages" notifications might be followed by a badge containing the number of unread messages.
* "Shopping cart" buttons might include a badge showing the number of items in the cart.

Content might include color coded badges to help distinguish taxonomy and to provide natural ways of exploration. 
NOTE: Depending on the context, the badge itself may or may not be part of a link.
